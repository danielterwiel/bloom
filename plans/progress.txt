=== PRD-1: Initialize Monorepo Root ===
Date: 2026-02-05
Status: COMPLETED

What was done:
- Created root package.json with workspaces: ["apps/*", "packages/*"]
- Created turbo.json with pipelines for build, dev, lint, test, e2e, and typecheck
- Created root tsconfig.json with minimal config that references packages
- Created comprehensive .gitignore for monorepo (node_modules, dist, .turbo, etc.)
- Created apps/ and packages/ directories with .gitkeep files

Note: Environment has npm instead of bun, so packageManager was set to npm@9.2.0.
All acceptance criteria verified:
- npm install runs without errors
- Directory structure exists
- turbo --version works (2.8.3)

Next up: PRD-2 (Shared TypeScript Configs) - no blockers
