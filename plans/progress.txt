=== PRD-1: Initialize Monorepo Root ===
Date: 2026-02-05
Status: COMPLETED

What was done:
- Created root package.json with workspaces: ["apps/*", "packages/*"]
- Created turbo.json with pipelines for build, dev, lint, test, e2e, and typecheck
- Created root tsconfig.json with minimal config that references packages
- Created comprehensive .gitignore for monorepo (node_modules, dist, .turbo, etc.)
- Created apps/ and packages/ directories with .gitkeep files

Note: Environment has npm instead of bun, so packageManager was set to npm@9.2.0.
All acceptance criteria verified:
- npm install runs without errors
- Directory structure exists
- turbo --version works (2.8.3)

Next up: PRD-2 (Shared TypeScript Configs) - no blockers

=== PRD-2: Shared TypeScript Configs ===
Date: 2026-02-05
Status: COMPLETED

What was done:
- Created packages/tsconfig/package.json as @repo/tsconfig workspace package
- Created packages/tsconfig/base.json with strict TypeScript settings:
  - ES2022 target, ESNext module
  - Full strict mode including noUncheckedIndexedAccess
  - verbatimModuleSyntax for ESM compliance
  - declaration and declarationMap for downstream consumers
- Created packages/tsconfig/react.json extending base with JSX support (react-jsx)
- Created packages/tsconfig/astro.json extending base with Astro JSX import source
- Removed packages/.gitkeep (no longer needed)

Acceptance criteria verified:
- Package is recognized by workspace (npm install succeeds)
- Configs can be extended via "extends": "@repo/tsconfig/base.json"
- All JSON configs validate without syntax errors

Next up: PRD-3 (Vitest Setup), PRD-4 (Playwright Setup), or PRD-6 (Tailwind Theme)
All three can run in parallel since PRD-2 is complete

=== PRD-3: Vitest Setup ===
Date: 2026-02-05
Status: COMPLETED

What was done:
- Installed vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 at root level
- Created vitest.workspace.ts to discover tests across packages/*/vitest.config.ts and apps/*/vitest.config.ts
- Created packages/ui/ package scaffold:
  - package.json with @repo/ui name, test and typecheck scripts
  - tsconfig.json extending @repo/tsconfig/base.json
  - vitest.config.ts for ui package
  - src/index.ts barrel export placeholder
  - src/__tests__/sample.test.ts with basic passing tests

Note: The test and test pipeline in turbo.json already existed from PRD-1.

Acceptance criteria verified:
- npm test runs Vitest via turbo (2 tests pass in 465ms)
- Sample test passes
- turbo test runs tests across packages (1 successful task)
- npm run typecheck passes for @repo/ui

Next up: PRD-4 (Playwright Setup), PRD-6 (Tailwind Theme Tokens)
Both can run in parallel
